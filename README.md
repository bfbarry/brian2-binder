# Brian 2 binder

This repository is designed for trying [Brian 2](https://github.com/brian-team/brian2) - A clock-driven simulator for spiking neural networks. Clicking the button below launches a tempory Jupyter notebook enabling you to run Brian2 simulations in your browser. The service is hosted on [mybinder.org](http://mybinder.org/) courtesy of [The Freeman Lab](http://thefreemanlab.com/).

For updates on Brian2, follow us on [twitter (@briansimulator)](https://twitter.com/briansimulator) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/briansimulator).
